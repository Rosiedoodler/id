Hello! My name is Katriona Marie Stagg.
    
This website was created to demonstrate my passions and skill in the web development and design field. Here, you'll find several pieces that I have collected here together showcasing my knowledge in web development and design. Both back-end and front-end development can be seen, as well as graphic design.

Web development always fascinated me. The concept of how a website does what it does, 
learning what makes it tick and the fun elements at play behind it, it's such an incredible experience. That knowledge can bring you up to do incredible things, and that's what I intend to show here.
